## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working
- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### All
- Replace all vh sizing with vw sizing (for proportional vertical margins when resizing horizontally)

### About page
- Go to Figma and redo the design of skills/education
- Make page consistent with the others, clean up design (content is fine)
- Responsive font sizing here too of course!

### Music page
- Put Nick Perrin Music logo up from hi-res vector
- Get some Soundcloud player or similar with a brief playlist of varied tracks
- Have a section below for other projects (albums, new tracks, etc)

### Contact page
- Make the contact button in navbar link to a #contact section in the about page, which is just a simple png of my email, with the "I designed this in figma blah blah blah..." below it.

### Final touches
- Need new pics for front page, and new photo for About page.
- Nav bar: remove placeholder logo, put non-bold all caps name on top left? Experiment
- Nav bar: resizing using vh/vw sizes instead of fixed sizing
- Videos for portfolio page replacing images
- HTML font linking replace css import
- Try enforcing font anti-aliasing? (seen in e.g. Devon Stank page in CSS)
