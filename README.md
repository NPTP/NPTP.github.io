## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working
- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Portfolio page
- Make slideshow code more efficient by removing need to call querySelectorAll on every timeout to the slides
- Cards should slide in on scroll, not before. Copy code from About page for this

### About page
- Make page consistent with the others, clean up design (content is fine)
- Responsive font sizing here too of course!

### Final touches
- Nav bar: remove placeholder logo, put non-bold all caps name on top left? Experiment
- Nav bar: resizing using vh/vw sizes instead of fixed sizing
- HTML font linking replace css import
- Try enforcing font anti-aliasing? (seen in e.g. Devon Stank page in CSS)
