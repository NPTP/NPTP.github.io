## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Index page
- Big buttons:
  - Have a container so the translation-hover effect can't be glitched out
  - Actually link to the appropriate pages!

### About page
- Redesign skills list
- Polish remaining animations

### Final touches
- Nav bar: remove placeholder logo, put non-bold all caps name on top left? Experiment
- HTML font linking replace css import
- Try to replace index page buttons with button-styled links to eliminate blue outline
- Try using font anti-aliasing (seen in e.g. Devon Stank page in CSS)
- Try a more complex animation on the index page only, keeping consistent animations between the others
