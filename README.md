## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working
- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Text overall
- Convert all text (including navbar sizing) to vw proportions for responsive viewing

### Index page
- Big buttons:
  - Remove raise-up on hover effect. Only do fade of colour and border

### About page
- Redesign skills list
- Polish remaining animations

### Final touches
- Nav bar: remove placeholder logo, put non-bold all caps name on top left? Experiment
- HTML font linking replace css import
- Try to replace index page buttons with button-styled links to eliminate blue outline
- Try using font anti-aliasing (seen in e.g. Devon Stank page in CSS)
- Try a more complex animation on the index page only, keeping consistent animations between the others
