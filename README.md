## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

- Try using font anti-aliasing (seen in e.g. Devon Stank page in CSS)
- Try using relative font-sizes (https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/) as also seen in Devon's page

### Nav bar
- Get "Active" page animation beginning to line up perfectly with end of animation on hover previously
- Fade in only on index page, be consistent elsewhere
- Remove placeholder logo, put non-bold all caps name on top left? Experiment

### Index page
- Formatting: use what you learned from About page to center items more concretely
- Big buttons:
  - Have a container so the translation-hover effect can't be glitched out
  - Go back "in" when clicked
  - Actually link to the appropriate pages!
- Nav bar: more complex animation, for index page only (keep simple fade on others)?

### About page
- Use side-by-side design
- Incorporate icons on About page http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/
- Continue migrating design from Figma

### Final touches
- HTML font linking replace css import
- Try to replace index page buttons with button-styled links to eliminate blue outline
