          I'm a lifelong gamer. I started making games on paper in the first
          grade. Soon after, I discovered game modding. Then I studied computer
          science to take things to the next level, and I continue to work on my
          own games.<br /><br />
          â€‹Inspired by great soundtracks from games (and all kinds of other
          music), I learned to make my own compositions and play the piano. I
          studied music and composition at school, and have worked on music and
          sound for games, as well as my own projects.<br /><br />
          My passion lies in creating something new and interesting. Videogames
          are an incredibly powerful medium and we are only beginning to scratch
          the surface of their possibilities.<br /><br />
          Let's do it.
