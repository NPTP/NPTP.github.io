## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working

- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Remaining TODO

- Game dev portfolio video reel as a youtube embed.
- Better image for the front page "Game developer" bubble in colour.
- Videos that play on hover over each portfolio card instead of the slideshows we have now (with exceptions like the Doom mod and any other in-progress card added later)
- Not sure yet: videos in the landing page bubbles? (Editing in Unity & photoshop for game dev. Editing in cubase, sound forge, and a shot of playing keys from one of the show promos for composer.) Maybe too complicated-looking.
- Replace rayltime download with an installer-based (using Inno Setup) one that handles all the weird folder library linking stuff and just gives the user an easy shortcut to use
- Learn how to make it do the hamburger menu thing on mobile
- Links to my other music pages (Audiojungle, bandcamp, Youtube, etc) on Music page
