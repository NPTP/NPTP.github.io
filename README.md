## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working

- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Front page

- Need new pic (at least for the game dev bubble pic)

### About page

- Responsive font sizing in top blurb about me
- Go to Figma and redo the design of skills/education
- Skills card first, education card second
- Contact info linked to by front page and nav bar
- At end of page, footnote about how I built the site, as in about_backup.html, tweaked
- Better (& newer) photo of me

### Portofolio page

- Videos that play on hover over each card instead of the slideshows we have now (with exceptions like the Doom mod and any other in-progress card added later)

### Music page

- Have a section below the music player for other projects (All Night Long band, albums, new tracks, etc), each on its own card just like the portfolio
- Add Eye for an Eye to the page's soundcloud playlist!

### Contact page

- Make the contact button in navbar link to a #contact section in the about page, which is just a simple png of my email, with the "I designed this in figma blah blah blah..." below it.

### Nav bar

- Make a globally-used js script which prepends the navbar in all pages so we have the navbar defined in a centralized way
- Changed the fix sizing to vh/vw sizes

### Final touches

- HTML font linking instead of css import: save as a final step
