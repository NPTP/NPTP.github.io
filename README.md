## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working

- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Todo

- Changed the navbar sizing to use vh/vw sizes (in progress)
- Make a globally-used js script which prepends the navbar html in all pages so we have the navbar defined in a centralized way
- Better (& newer) photo of me on the About page
- HTML font linking instead of css import
- Link the github site to nickperrin.com domain URL

### Extra steps to spruce things up

- Replace rayltime download with an installer-based (using Inno Setup) one that handles all the weird folder library linking stuff and just gives the user an easy shortcut to use
- Videos that play on hover over each portfolio card instead of the slideshows we have now (with exceptions like the Doom mod and any other in-progress card added later)
- Videos in the landing page bubbles? (Editing in Unity, photoshop for game dev. Editing in cubase, sound forge, and a shot of playing keys from one of the show promos for composer.)
