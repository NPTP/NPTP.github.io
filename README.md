## Todo list (items removed as they are completed)

### Useful links while working

- jQuery to vanilla JS:
  - http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
  - https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/
- Relative font sizing: https://www.sitepoint.com/new-css3-relative-font-size/

### Todo

- Link the github site to nickperrin.com domain URL

### Extra steps to spruce things up

- Videos that play on hover over each portfolio card instead of the slideshows we have now (with exceptions like the Doom mod and any other in-progress card added later)
- Not sure yet: videos in the landing page bubbles? (Editing in Unity & photoshop for game dev. Editing in cubase, sound forge, and a shot of playing keys from one of the show promos for composer.)
- If not videos (may not look great, too complicated, etc) then at least a better pic for the game dev bubble.
- Replace rayltime download with an installer-based (using Inno Setup) one that handles all the weird folder library linking stuff and just gives the user an easy shortcut to use
